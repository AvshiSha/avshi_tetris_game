# Avshi Tetris Game

Welcome to a fresh twist on the classic Tetris challenge! Created by me, this project spices up your gameplay with fun bonuses and vibrant visuals.

- **Colors Bonus:** Choose your adventure! Play in classic black and white, or switch on dazzling colors to light up your game.
- **Box Score Bonus:** Keep track of your progress with a cool score display that adds an extra edge to every game.
- **Human vs. Computer Mode:** Go head-to-head with the computer—watch as your moves light up the left board, while the AI battles on the right.
- **Custom Difficulty:** Tailor your challenge with three difficulty levels: "Novice," "Good," or "Best."
- **Smart Design:** The game’s structure is built on a solid object-oriented foundation, where the `Player` class is the hero for both human and computer competitors.
